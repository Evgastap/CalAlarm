# CalAlarm
Hey, you! Yes, you ðŸ‘€ Why are you here?

If you're here to check out my previous projects, enjoy:

- my first attempt at setting my computer on fire using Android Studio, 
- attempting to whack code together from Stackoverflow posts with 1 upvote and 1 comment, and 
- trying to use Google Cal API calls so obscure that they either get 1 or no hits at all on Google.

All whilst not exactly knowing what Java classes are.

You're still here? Well, my goal with this project was to get to know more about Android apps, all whilst implementing the brilliant idea of an alarm based on my Google Calendar events. 

Just as any first-year college student I thought, "how can I optimize the amount of hours I sleep?"

The answer was obvious - some days, my lectures started at 9. Some started at 11. Why not have an app that sets my alarm depending on what time the first lecture is?
